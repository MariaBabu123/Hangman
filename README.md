# Hangman Game in Python

## Overview
This is a Python-based command-line Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of attempts to guess the word correctly before the game is over.

## Features
- Random word selection from a list defined in `hangman_words.py`.
- ASCII art displayed using designs from `hangman_art.py`.
- Tracks the player's guesses and remaining attempts.
- Displays the word's progress, showing correctly guessed letters.

## How to Play
1. The game will randomly choose a word from the list in `hangman_words.py`.
2. You'll be prompted to guess one letter at a time.
3. Correct guesses will reveal the letter's position in the word.
4. Incorrect guesses will reduce the number of remaining attempts, and part of the hangman will be drawn.
5. The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
